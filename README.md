##Description
This game is developed for fun. It requires two players. Each has a turn. On each turn a player rolls a dice as many times as he wants until a dice rolls "1". Or he can decide to pass the dice before the dice rolls "1". If a dice rolls "1". All the points he gained in that turn are lost. So it's very tricky to decide when to pass the dice and when to keep playing it.
